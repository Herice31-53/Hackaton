# Hackaton

## Overview
This project implements a Hackaton contract on the SmartPy platform, designed to manage a traceable supply chain for various products. It utilizes a blockchain approach to ensure the traceability of products throughout their lifecycle, from production through distribution. The contract supports operations like product creation, production, transportation, transformation, and distribution, with an emphasis on environmental and cost considerations.
